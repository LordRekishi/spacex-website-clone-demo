# SpaceX Website Clone Demo

This demo is made while following [an amazing tutorial](https://youtu.be/wryPX7KSwSc) made by [Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/@TraversyMedia). This is a partial website clone of the [SpaceX Website](https://www.spacex.com/) with animations for the nav, hamburger menu and on the content of the different sections with a focus on trying to clone the actual SpaceX website as closely as possible.

### All images and such belong to SpaceX, this is just for learning purposes.
